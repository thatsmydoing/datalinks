# Data Processing

For the most part, extracting information was straightforward. Everything is in
a pseudo CSV format and it's well documented.

## Tech Images

The source tech images have the wrong colors for their direction (build,
conquer, discover, explore) and I had to recolor them with information from
alphax.txt.

## Facility Numbering

Base Facilities and Secret Projects belong to the same list in alphax.txt. This
is why secret project links start from 110070. Also, blurbs and facility images
use a different numbering (not position in the list). Facilities between 34 and
41 are numbered 330 to 410 (add a zero at the end), while facilities between 65
and 69 map to 34 to 38.
