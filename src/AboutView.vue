    <p>The Datalinks are the in-game manual of <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier's_Alpha_Centauri">Sid Meier's
    Alpha Centauri</a> by Firaxis. It is similar to the Civilopedia in
    Civilization games.</p>
    <p>This is an HTML recreation of that, along with most of the graphics and
    audio from the game. I have tried to stay true to the original look and feel
    so what you see here is almost how it appears in the actual game.</p>
    <p>All the information here was extracted from the game's source files with
    <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=291246">some
    improvements</a> from fans of the game, and also from the <a
    href="http://alphacentauri2.info/wiki/Main_Page">AC Wiki</a>. None of the
    content here is my own and they belong to their respective owners.</p>
    <p>If you want to check out how the site was built, or want to report an
    issue, check it out <a href="https://github.com/thatsmydoing/datalinks">on
    Github</a>.</p>
    <p>There are still some assets which are missing for various reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Missing images for units, chassis, reactors, weapons and armor until I
      can figure out how to render the source 3D models.</li>
      <li>No audio for secret project quotes since those are videos which I'd
      rather not upload.</li>
    </ul>
